ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* Android.mk
* CleanSpec.mk
* MODULE_LICENSE_APACHE2
* NOTICE
* proguard.flags
* tests/
* tests/Android.mk

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/
* src/com/android/cabl/ICABLService.aidl => app/src/main/aidl/com/android/cabl/ICABLService.aidl
* src/com/android/display/IPPService.aidl => app/src/main/aidl/com/android/display/IPPService.aidl
* src/com/android/location/XT/IXTSrv.aidl => app/src/main/aidl/com/android/location/XT/IXTSrv.aidl
* src/com/android/location/XT/IXTSrvCb.aidl => app/src/main/aidl/com/android/location/XT/IXTSrvCb.aidl
* src/com/lava/security/services/IExternalService.aidl => app/src/main/aidl/com/lava/security/services/IExternalService.aidl
* tests/res/ => app/src/androidTest/res/
* tests/src/ => app/src/androidTest/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
